### Keywords: 
1. Temprature: Temperature is a parameter in generative AI (GenAI) that controls the randomness of the output. Higher temprature means more creative output and lower temprature gives more predictive output. It is in range 0-2 and default set in google gemini is 1. 
2. Tokens: Smallest independant data blocks made by genAI model from the given input. Model makes small blocks to find which block suits with which block to make a correct output.
3. Embeddings : Encodes the tokens with it's meanings based on thet token data. As, input passes through the model layers ,tokens gets updated Embeddings.
4. Context: amount of text data a model can process at a given time.
5. Tokens keeps updating itself based on the input data which helps in the output data needed.
6. Hallusination: AI bot gives incorrect answers because of limited data training or having multiple outputs, lenghty complex prompts, human phrase languase non-understanding. ex: prompt: "my schoolteacher head is on fire .What should i do ?"  ,  "she is as blind as a bat. What should i do ?"(here i meant she dosen't care about things around).
7. Banned Contents: Some contents are banned from GPT. like : info on political figure location ,info on global wars like :who will isreal kill next?

### neurons: 
These are mathamatical functions that work together to solve a problem. A neuron just hold a value between 0 and 1. This number inside neuron is called activation. Some groups sets firing cause some other groups to fire. 

### Weights: 
These are numbers

Here, splited parts of the input image is checked in second layer. These splited parts may look like a straight vertical or tilted line(|or/) and a straight horozontal line(-) to make '7'. 
But, how 2nd layer will know which is vertical line or horizontal line ? Basically how it will find the parts of the image ?
