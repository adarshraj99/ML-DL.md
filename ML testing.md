### Types of testing: 
- responsible ai testing, post production testing, shift left testing, Prompting testing, Memory Testing ,Context testing, 

### Examples of ML: 
- Spam filters in emails,  Promotion recomendation engines by user preferences,  Predective maintainance for industrial equipments.

### Strengths and Limitations: 
- Flexiblity: Can get results even when data is not feeded to the ML model, because it already learned from the previous data and it analyzes with predections.
- Scalablity: Can give broader results than the conditional results from an expret based traditional systems.
- Interpretability: ML models have  less interpretability and we don't know the outputs (As it's a prediction by machine). In expert based systems, Reactions are defined.

### ML Model Life cycle:

- Devs use Training data and testers have validation data.
- Validation data have 2 problems: Underfitting(Need more data training on seen data) and Overfitting(If a high accuracy model is trained on more related but un-useful data than needed(ex: giving house colour,designs,facing directions. model can't predict price accurately). efficiency goes down, ). 
- GoodFit: after UnderFitting, when model starts giving better results. Itis said a goodfit.
